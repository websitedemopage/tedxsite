                            Muthoot Institute of Technology and Science (MITS)
                            is one of the premier private engineering colleges
                            in Kerala by consistently being a rank holder in the

                            The second edition of TEDxMITS loosely revolves
                            around the theme of
                            <b style="color: white;">
                                "CRUSH THE CLICHE"
                            </b>
                            . In today's world where our perceptions are
                            obscured by conventional boundaries and parochial
                            ideologies narrow it down to the prism of
                            prejudices, we hope to bring together ideas and
                            spirits to explore non alienation and "crash" what's
                            conventional. We hope to bring together ideas and
                            spirits woven around the topic to foster learning,
                            inspiration and wonder. Ultimately, we aim at
                            provoking conversations that matter.

                            Your talk would be filmed and an edit will be hosted
                            on the TEDx YouTube channel. Just as with all
                            speakers, we could work together ahead of time to
                            craft the talk. Your talk could be up to 18 minutes
                            hovering over the theme.
                            <br>
                            We believe your voice would be a critical addition
                            to the TEDxMITS stage. Please let us know whether or
                            not youâ€™d be interested in speaking.
